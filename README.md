# Celo MIT IAP Resources
This is the home of all the resources participants will need in order to build their own automated trading strategies in the Celo MIT IAP challenge.

## Requirements

## NVM

NVM (Node Version Manager) helps to manage which version of node you currently have running. Install it [here](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation)

Then, use NVM to install a version of node:
```
nvm install v8.12.0 && nvm use v8.12.0
```


## Yarn

Yarn is a better [npm (node package manager)](https://www.npmjs.com/) client. It installs the dependencies necessary to run all of the projects. Install it - make sure to use the `--without-node` flag since we are using nvm - [here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable)


## Git

Git is a distributed version control system. GitHub is where we host our code. 

Clone this repositry.
